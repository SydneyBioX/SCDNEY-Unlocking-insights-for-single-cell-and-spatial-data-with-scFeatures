Description: As single-cell technology advances, the number of multi-condition multi-sample datasets increases. The workshop will discuss the challenges and analytical focus associated with disease outcome prediction and prognosis using multi-condition multi-sample spatial patient data. We will also talk about general analytic strategies and the critical thinking questions that arise in the process.
